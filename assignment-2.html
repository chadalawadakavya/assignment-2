<p><b>Java is platform independent because it is different from other languages like C
, etc. which are compiled into platform specific machines while Java is a write once, run anywhere language. A platform is the hardware or software environment in which a program runs.

There are two types of platforms software-based and hardware-based. Java provides a software-based platform.

The Java platform differs from most other platforms in the sense that it is a software-based platform that runs on top of other hardware-based platforms. It has two components:

Runtime Environment
API(Application Programming Interface)</p></b>
<p><b>Robust
The English mining of Robust is strong. Java is robust because:

<br><br>
It uses strong memory management.
There is a lack of pointers that avoids security problems.
Java provides automatic garbage collection which runs on the Java Virtual Machine to get rid of objects which are not being used by a Java application anymore.
There are exception handling and the type checking mechanism in Java. All these points make Java robust</p></b>
<p><b>Java is very easy to learn, and its syntax is simple, clean and easy to understand. According to Sun Microsystem, Java language is a simple programming language because:

Java syntax is based on C++ (so easier for programmers to learn it after C++).
Java has removed many complicated and rarely-used features, for example, explicit pointers, operator overloading, etc.
There is no need to remove unreferenced objects because there is an Automatic Garbage Collection in Java.</p></b>
